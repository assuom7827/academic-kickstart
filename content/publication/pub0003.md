abstract = "In universities with a large number of students, the cost of these RLs becomes a problem, then they will be hard to respond to high demand, however, sharing and pooling resources involves setting up platforms that use the same language, offer the same services and exchange the same data formats. The proposed system allows sharing experiences for different students over a web interface. In addition, it allows developing remote laboratory at low cost, which will allow serving more users at the same time. A practical case will be detailed to show the feasibility and validation of the approach."
